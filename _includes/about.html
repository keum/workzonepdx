                    <h3>BACKGROUND</h3>

                    <p>Portland's streets are widely recognized as being safe and accessible for people walking and bicycling except when work on or adjacent to those streets interrupts foot and bike traffic. Vision Zero must guide the design of our work zones.</p>

                    <h3>PROBLEM</h3>

                    <p>Utility companies, private construction, and city bureaus interrupt the regular flow of our transportation network frequently enough that it has become a chronic problem. When this work interrupts motor vehicle access, safe, direct, and logical detours are designed and implemented. Walking and biking routes, however, are rarely given the same considerations. Instead, people walking and biking are left without clear directions, safe alternatives, and reasonable accommodation. In many cases, on-street parking and additional vehicle lanes are maintained while sidewalks and bike lanes are interrupted without warning. This misplaced prioritization suggests that work zone traffic control plans are not required to avoid or mitigate construction impacts to our bike and pedestrian networks. Despite the fact that the Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) is responsible for our streets, the bureau does not dictate and enforce adequate standards for the work they permit in their right of way.</p>

                    <h3>PROPOSAL</h3>

                    <p>We call upon the City of Portland to pass a new ordinance requiring all city bureaus, contractors, and private parties to maintain a safe and direct bicycle and pedestrian network during any planned / non-emergency construction in the city right of way. No interruption shall be permitted without provision of a safe, logical, direct detour for vulnerable roadway users.</p>
