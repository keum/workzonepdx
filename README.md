# Vision Zero Work Zones

Experimenting with a workflow for aggregating images/video/commentary from social media and curating compelling stories and maps.

The idea is that we can work with people passionate about an issue to quickly capture its breadth and depth in a very real and tangible way, then funnel it to decision makers to support specific policy changes.

This first project focuses on the issue of poorly designed sidewalk and street closures for construction, and the accessibility and safety issues that they often pose for pedestrians and bikers.  If it works out we can generalize for quick deployment.

The whole point is to piece together existing services at little to no cost. Tech stack so far includes Twitter/Instagram APIs, Zapier, Google Sheets, Google App Script, Tabletop.js, Jekyll/Github Pages, and probably Leaflet.  Others welcome if you want to spearhead.
